## Multitasking

One of the fundamental features of most operating systems is [_multitasking_], which is the ability to execute multiple tasks concurrently. For example, you probably have other programs open while looking at this post, such as a text editor or a terminal window. Even if you have only a single browser window open, there are probably various background tasks for managing your desktop windows, checking for updates, or indexing files.

[_multitasking_]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking

While it seems like all tasks run in parallel, only a single task can be executed on a CPU core at a time. To create the illusion that the tasks run in parallel, the operating system rapidly switches between active tasks so that each one can make a bit of progress. Since computers are fast, we don't notice these switches most of the time.

While single-core CPUs can only execute a single task at a time, multi-core CPUs can run multiple tasks in a truly parallel way. For example, a CPU with 8 cores can run 8 tasks at the same time. We will explain how to setup multi-core CPUs in a future post. For this post, we will focus on single-core CPUs for simplicity. (It's worth noting that all multi-core CPUs start with only a single active core, so we can treat them as single-core CPUs for now.)

There are two forms of multitasking: _Cooperative_ multitasking requires tasks to regularly give up control of the CPU so that other tasks can make progress. _Preemptive_ multitasking uses operating system capabilities to switch threads at arbitrary points in time by forcibly pausing them. In the following we will explore the two forms of multitasking in more detail and discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks.

### Preemptive Multitasking

The idea behind preemptive multitasking is that the operating system controls when to switch tasks. For that, it utilizes the fact that it regains control of the CPU on each interrupt. This makes it possible to switch tasks whenever new input is available to the system. For example, it would be possible to switch tasks when the mouse is moved or a network packet arrives. The operating system can also determine the exact time that a task is allowed to run by configuring a hardware timer to send an interrupt after that time.

The following graphic illustrates the task switching process on a hardware interrupt:

![](regain-control-on-interrupt.svg)

In the first row, the CPU is executing task `A1` of program `A`. All other tasks are paused. In the second row, a hardware interrupt arrives at the CPU. As described in the [_Hardware Interrupts_] post, the CPU immediately stops the execution of task `A1` and jumps to the interrupt handler defined in the interrupt descriptor table (IDT). Through this interrupt handler, the operating system now has control of the CPU again, which allows it to switch to task `B1` instead of continuing task `A1`.

[_Hardware Interrupts_]: @/second-edition/posts/07-hardware-interrupts/index.md

#### Saving State

Since tasks are interrupted at arbitrary points in time, they might be in the middle of some calculation. In order to be able to resume them later, the operating system must backup the whole state of the task, including its [call stack] and the values of all CPU registers. This process is called a [_context switch_].

[call stack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack
[_context switch_]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch

As the call stack can be very large, the operating system typically sets up a separate call stack for each task instead of backing up the call stack content on each task switch. Such a task with a separate stack is called a [_thread of execution_] or _thread_ for short. By using a separate stack for each task, only the register contents need to be saved on a context switch (including the program counter and stack pointer). This approach minimizes the performance overhead of a context switch, which is very important since context switches often occur up to 100 times per second.

[_thread of execution_]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)

#### Discussion

The main advantage of preemptive multitasking is that the operating system can fully control the allowed execution time of a task. This way, it can guarantee that each task gets a fair share of the CPU time, without the need to trust the tasks to cooperate. This is especially important when running third-party tasks or when multiple users share a system.

The disadvantage of preemption is that each task requires its own stack. Compared to a shared stack, this results in a higher memory usage per task and often limits the number of tasks in the system. Another disadvantage is that the operating system always has to save the complete CPU register state on each task switch, even if the task only used a small subset of the registers.

Preemptive multitasking and threads are fundamental components of an operating system because they make it possible to run untrusted userspace programs. We will discuss these concepts in full detail in future posts. For this post, however, we will focus on cooperative multitasking, which also provides useful capabilities for our kernel.

### Cooperative Multitasking

Instead of forcibly pausing running tasks at arbitrary points in time, cooperative multitasking lets each task run until it voluntarily gives up control of the CPU. This allows tasks to pause themselves at convenient points in time, for example when it needs to wait for an I/O operation anyway.

Cooperative multitasking is often used at the language level, for example in form of [coroutines] or [async/await]. The idea is that either the programmer or the compiler inserts [_yield_] operations into the program, which give up control of the CPU and allow other tasks to run. For example, a yield could be inserted after each iteration of a complex loop.

[coroutines]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine
[async/await]: https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html
[_yield_]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(multithreading)

It is common to combine cooperative multitasking with [asynchronous operations]. Instead of [blocking] until an operation is finished and preventing other tasks to run in this time, asynchronous operations return a "not ready" status if the operation is not finished yet. In this case, the waiting task can execute a yield operation to let other tasks run.

[asynchronous operations]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O
[blocking]: http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Device/blocking.html

#### Saving State

Since tasks define their pause points themselves, they don't need the operating system to save their state. Instead, they can save exactly the state they need for continuation before they pause themselves, which often results in better performance. For example, a task that just finished a complex computation might only need to backup the final result of the computation since it does not need the intermediate results anymore.

Language-supported implementations of cooperative tasks are often even able to backup up the required parts of the call stack before pausing. As an example, Rust's async/await implementation stores all local variables that are still needed in an automatically generated struct (see below). By backing up the relevant parts of the call stack before pausing, all tasks can share the same call stack, which results in a much smaller memory consumption per task. As a result, it is possible to create an almost arbitrary number of tasks without running out of memory.

#### Discussion

The drawback of cooperative multitasking is that an uncooperative task can potentially run for an unlimited amount of time. Thus, a malicious or buggy task can prevent other tasks from running and slow down or even block the whole system. For this reason, cooperative multitasking should only be used when all tasks are known to cooperate. As a counterexample, it's not a good idea to make the operating system rely on the cooperation of arbitrary userlevel programs.

However, the strong performance and memory benefits of cooperative multitasking make it a good approach for usage _within_ a program, especially in combination with asynchronous operations. Since an operating system kernel is a performance-critical program that interacts with asynchronous hardware, cooperative multitasking seems like a good approach for concurrency in our kernel.

## Async/Await in Rust

The Rust language provides first-class support for cooperative multitasking in form of async/await. Before we can explore what async/await is and how it works, we need to understand how _futures_ and asynchronous programming work in Rust.

### Futures

A _future_ represents a value that might not be available yet. This could be for example an integer that is computed by another task or a file that is downloaded from the network. Instead of waiting until the value is available, futures make it possible to continue execution until the value is needed.

#### Example

The concept of futures is best illustrated with a small example:

![Sequence diagram: main calls `read_file` and is blocked until it returns; then it calls `foo()` and is also blocked until it returns. The same process is repeated, but this time `async_read_file` is called, which directly returns a future; then `foo()` is called again, which now runs concurrently to the file load. The file is available before `foo()` returns.](async-example.svg)

This sequence diagram shows a `main` function that reads a file from the file system and then calls a function `foo`. This process is repeated two times: Once with a synchronous `read_file` call and once with an asynchronous `async_read_file` call.

With the synchronous call, the `main` function needs to wait until the file is loaded from the file system. Only then it can call the `foo` function, which requires it to again wait for the result.

With the asynchronous `async_read_file` call, the file system directly returns a future and loads the file asynchronously in the background. This allows the `main` function to call `foo` much earlier, which then runs in parallel with the file load. In this example, the file load even finishes before `foo` returns, so `main` can directly work with the file without further waiting after `foo` returns.

#### Futures in Rust

In Rust, futures are represented by the [`Future`] trait, which looks like this:

[`Future`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/future/trait.Future.html

```rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
```

The [associated type] `Output` specfies the type of the asynchronous value. For example, the `async_read_file` function in the diagram above would return a `Future` instance with `Output` set to `File`.

[associated type]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types

The [`poll`] method allows to check if the value is already available. It returns a [`Poll`] enum, which looks like this:

[`poll`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll
[`Poll`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/task/enum.Poll.html

```rust
pub enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,
}
```

When the value is already available (e.g. the file was fully read from disk), it is returned wrapped in the `Ready` variant. Otherwise, the `Pending` variant is returned, which signals the caller that the value is not yet available.

The `poll` method takes two arguments: `self: Pin<&mut Self>` and `cx: &mut Context`. The former behaves like a normal `&mut self` reference, with the difference that the `Self` value is [_pinned_] to its memory location. Understanding `Pin` and why it is needed is difficult without understanding how async/await works first. We will therefore explain it later in this post.

[_pinned_]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/index.html

The purpose of the `cx: &mut Context` parameter is to pass a [`Waker`] instance to the asynchronous task, e.g. the file system load. This `Waker` allows the asynchronous task to signal that it (or a part of it) is finished, e.g. that the file was loaded from disk. Since the main task knows that it will be notified when the `Future` is ready, it does not need to call `poll` over and over again. We will explain this process in more detail later in this post when we implement an own `Waker` type.

[`Waker`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/task/struct.Waker.html

### Working with Futures

We now know how futures are defined and understand the basic idea behind the `poll` method. However, we still don't know how to effectively work with futures. The problem is that futures represent results of asynchronous tasks, which might be not available yet. In practice, however, we often need these values directly for further calculations. So the question is: How can we efficiently retrieve the value of a future when we need it?

#### Waiting on Futures

One possible answer is to wait until a future becomes ready. This could look something like this:

```rust
let future = async_read_file("foo.txt");
let file_content = loop {
    match future.poll(…) {
        Poll::Ready(value) => break value,
        Poll::Pending => {}, // do nothing
    }
}
```

Here we _actively_ wait for the future by calling `poll` over and over again in a loop. The arguments to `poll` don't matter here, so we omitted them. While this solution works, it is very inefficient because we keep the CPU busy until the value becomes available.

A more efficient approach could be to _block_ the current thread until the future becomes available. This is of course only possible if you have threads, so this solution does not work for our kernel, at least not yet. Even on systems where blocking is supported, it is often not desired because it turns an asynchronous task into a synchronous task again, thereby inhibiting the potential performance benefits of parallel tasks.

#### Future Combinators

An alternative to waiting is to use future combinators. Future combinators are functions like `map` that allow chaining and combining futures together, similar to the functions on [`Iterator`]. Instead of waiting on the future, these combinators return a future themselves, which applies the mapping operation on `poll`.

[`Iterator`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html

As an example, a simple `string_len` combinator for converting `Future<Output = String>` to a `Future<Output = usize` could look like this:

```rust
struct StringLen<F> {
    inner_future: F,
}

impl<F> Future for StringLen<F> where Fut: Future<Output = String> {
    type Output = usize;

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<T> {
        match self.inner_future.poll(cx) {
            Poll::Ready(s) => Poll::Ready(s.len()),
            Poll::Pending => Poll::Pending,
        }
    }
}

fn string_len(string: impl Future<Output = String>)
    -> impl Future<Output = usize>
{
    StringLen {
        inner_future: string,
    }
}

// Usage
fn file_len() -> impl Future<Output = usize> {
    let file_content_future = async_read_file("foo.txt");
    string_len(file_content_future)
}
```

This code does not quite work because it does not handle [_pinning_], but it suffices as an example. The basic idea is that the `string_len` function wraps a given `Future` instance into a new `StringLen` struct, which also implements `Future`. When the wrapped future is polled, it polls the inner future. If the value is not ready yet, `Poll::Pending` is returned from the wrapped future too. If the value is ready, the string is extracted from the `Poll::Ready` variant and its length is calculated. Afterwards, it is wrapped in `Poll::Ready` again and returned.

[_pinning_]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/pin/index.html

With this `string_len` function, we can calculate the length of an asynchronous string without waiting for it. Since the function returns a `Future` again, the caller can't work directly on the returned value, but needs to use combinator functions again. This way, the whole call graph becomes asynchronous and we can efficiently wait for multiple futures at once at some point, e.g. in the main function.

Manually writing combinator functions is difficult, therefore they are often provided by libraries. While the Rust standard library itself provides no combinator methods yet, the semi-official (and `no_std` compatible) [`futures`] crate does. Its [`FutureExt`] trait provides high-level combinator methods such as [`map`] or [`then`], which can be used to manipulate the result with arbitrary closures.

[`futures`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/
[`FutureExt`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/future/trait.FutureExt.html
[`map`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/future/trait.FutureExt.html#method.map
[`then`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/future/trait.FutureExt.html#method.then

##### Advantages

The big advantage of future combinators is that they keep the operations asynchronous. In combination with asynchronous I/O interfaces, this approach can lead to very high performance. The fact that future combinators are implemented as normal structs with trait implementations allows the compiler to excessively optimize them. For more details, see the [_Zero-cost futures in Rust_] post, which announced the addition of futures to the Rust ecosystem.

[_Zero-cost futures in Rust_]: https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/

##### Drawbacks

While future combinators make it possible to write very efficient code, they can be difficult to use in some situations because of the type system and the closure based interface. For example, consider code like this:

```rust
fn example(min_len: usize) -> impl Future<Output = String> {
    async_read_file("foo.txt").then(move |content| {
        if content.len() < min_len {
            Either::Left(async_read_file("bar.txt").map(|s| content + &s))
        } else {
            Either::Right(future::ready(content))
        }
    })
}
```

([Try it on the playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=91fc09024eecb2448a85a7ef6a97b8d8))

Here we read the file `foo.txt` and then use the [`then`] combinator to chain a second future based on the file content. If the content length is smaller than the given `min_len`, we read a different `bar.txt` file and append it to `content` using the [`map`] combinator. Otherwise we return only the content of `foo.txt`.

We need to use the [`move` keyword] for the closure passed to `then` because otherwise there would be a lifetime error for `min_len`. The reason for the [`Either`] wrapper is that if and else blocks must always have the same type. Since we return different future types in the blocks, we must use the wrapper type to unify them into a single type. The [`ready`] function wraps a value into a future, which is immediately ready. The function is required here because the `Either` wrapper expects that the wrapped value implements `Future`.

[`move` keyword]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.move.html
[`Either`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/future/enum.Either.html
[`ready`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/future/fn.ready.html

As you can imagine, this can quickly lead to very complex code for larger projects. It gets especially complicated if borrowing and different lifetimes are involved. For this reason, a lot of work was invested to add support for async/await to Rust, with the goal of making asynchronous code radically simpler to write.

### The Async/Await Pattern

The idea behind async/await is to let the programmer write code that _looks_ like normal synchronous code, but is turned into asynchronous code by the compiler. It works based on the two keywords `async` and `await`. The `async` keyword can be used in a function signature to turn a synchronous function into an asynchronous function that returns a future:

```rust
async fn foo() -> u32 {
    0
}

// the above is roughly translated by the compiler to:
fn foo() -> impl Future<Output = u32> {
    future::ready(0)
}
```

This keyword alone wouldn't be that useful. However, inside `async` functions, the `await` keyword can be used to retrieve the asynchronous value of a future:

```rust
async fn example(min_len: usize) -> String {
    let content = async_read_file("foo.txt").await;
    if content.len() < min_len {
        content + &async_read_file("bar.txt").await
    } else {
        content
    }
}
```

([Try it on the playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=d93c28509a1c67661f31ff820281d434))

This function is a direct translation of the `example` function above, which used combinator functions. Using the `.await` operator, we can retrieve the value of a future without needing any closures or `Either` types. As a result, we can write our code like we write normal synchronous code, with the difference that _this is still asynchronous code_.

#### State Machine Transformation

What the compiler does behind this scenes is to transform the body of the `async` function into a [_state machine_], with each `.await` call representing a different state. For the above `example` function, the compiler creates a state machine with the following four states:

[_state machine_]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine

![Four states: start, waiting on foo.txt, waiting on bar.txt, end](async-state-machine-states.svg)

Each state represents a different pause point of the function. The _"Start"_ and _"End"_ states represent the function at the beginning and end of its execution. The _"Waiting on foo.txt"_ state represents that the function is currently waiting for the first `async_read_file` result. Similarly, the _"Waiting on bar.txt"_ state represents the pause point where the function is waiting on the second `async_read_file` result.

The state machine implements the `Future` trait by making each `poll` call a possible state transition:

![Four states: start, waiting on foo.txt, waiting on bar.txt, end](async-state-machine-basic.svg)

The diagram uses arrows to represent state switches and diamond shapes to represent alternative ways. For example, if the `foo.txt` file is not ready, the path marked with _"no"_ is takes and the _"Waiting on foo.txt"_ state is reached. Otherwise, the _"yes"_ path is taken. The small red diamond without caption represents the `if content.len() < 100` branch of the `example` function.

We see that the first `poll` call starts the function and lets it run until it reaches a future that is not ready yet. If all futures on the path are ready, the function can run till the _"End"_ state, where it returns its result wrapped in `Poll::Ready`. Otherwise, the state machine enters a waiting state and returns `Poll::Pending`. On the next `poll` call, the state machine then starts from the last waiting state and retries the last operation.

#### Saving State

In order to be able to continue from the last waiting state, the state machine must save it internally. In addition, it must save all the variables that it needs to continue execution on the next `poll` call. This is where the compiler can really shine: Since it knows which variables are used when, it can automatically generate structs with exactly the variables that are needed.

As an example, the compiler generates the following structs for the above `example` function:

```rust
// The `example` function again so that you don't have to scroll up
async fn example(min_len: usize) -> String {
    let content = async_read_file("foo.txt").await;
    if content.len() < min_len {
        content + &async_read_file("bar.txt").await
    } else {
        content
    }
}

// The compiler-generated state structs:

struct StartState {
    min_len: usize,
}

struct WaitingOnFooTxtState {
    min_len: usize,
    foo_txt_future: impl Future<Output = String>,
}

struct WaitingOnBarTxtState {
    content: String,
    bar_txt_future: impl Future<Output = String>,
}

struct EndState {}
```

In the "start" and _"Waiting on foo.txt"_ states, the `min_len` parameter needs to be stored because it is required for the comparison with `content.len()` later. The _"Waiting on foo.txt"_ state additionally stores a `foo_txt_future`, which represents the future returned by the `async_read_file` call. This future needs to be polled again when the state machine continues, so it needs to be saved.

The _"Waiting on bar.txt"_ state contains the `content` variable because it is needed for the string concatenation after `bar.txt` is ready. It also stores a `bar_txt_future` that represents the in-progress load of `bar.txt`. The struct does not contain the `min_len` variable because it is no longer needed after the `content.len()` comparison. In the _"end"_ state, no variables are stored because the function did already run to completion.

Keep in mind that this is only an example for the code that the compiler could generate. The struct names and the field layout are an implementation detail and might be different.

#### The Full State Machine Type

While the exact compiler-generated code is an implementation detail, it helps in understanding to imagine how the generated state machine _could_ look for the `example` function. We already defined the structs representing the different states and containing the required variables. To create a state machine on top of them, we can combine them into an [`enum`]:

[`enum`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html

```rust
enum ExampleStateMachine {
    Start(StartState),
    WaitingOnFooTxt(WaitingOnFooTxtState),
    WaitingOnBarTxt(WaitingOnBarTxtState),
    End(EndState),
}
```

We define a separate enum variant for each state and add the corresponding state struct to each variant as a field. To implement the state transitions, the compiler generates an implementation of the `Future` trait based on the `example` function:

```rust
impl Future for ExampleStateMachine {
    type Output = String; // return type of `example`

    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        loop {
            match self { // TODO: handle pinning
                ExampleStateMachine::Start(state) => {…}
                ExampleStateMachine::WaitingOnFooTxt(state) => {…}
                ExampleStateMachine::WaitingOnFooTxt(state) => {…}
                ExampleStateMachine::End(state) => {…}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `Output` type of the future is `String` because it's the return type of the `example` function. To implement the `poll` function, we use a match statement on the current state inside a `loop`. The idea is that we switch to the next state as long as possible and use an explicit `return Poll::Pending` when we can't continue.

For simplicity, we only show simplified code and don't handle [pinning][_pinning_], ownership, lifetimes, etc. So this and the following code should be treated as pseudo-code and not used directly. Of course, the real compiler-generated code handles everything correctly, albeit possibly in a different way.

To keep the code excerpts small, we present the code for each match arm separately. Let's begin with the `Start` state:

```rust
ExampleStateMachine::Start(state) => {
    // from body of `example`
    let foo_txt_future = async_read_file("foo.txt");
    // `.await` operation
    let state = WaitingOnFooTxtState {
        min_len: state.min_len,
        foo_txt_future,
    };
    *self = ExampleStateMachine::WaitingOnFooTxt(state);
}
```

The state machine is in the `Start` state when it is right at the beginning of the function. In this case, we execute all the code from the body of the `example` function until the first `.await`. To make the code more readable, we introduce a new `foo_txt_future` to represent the future returned by `async_read_file` right before the `.await`. To handle the `.await` operation, we change the state of `self` to `WaitingOnFooTxt`, which includes the construction of the `WaitingOnFooTxtState` struct.

Since the `match self {…}` statement is executed in a loop, the execution jumps to the `WaitingOnFooTxt` arm next:

```rust
ExampleStateMachine::WaitingOnFooTxt(state) => {
    match state.foo_txt_future.poll(cx) {
        Poll::Pending => return Poll::Pending,
        Poll::Ready(content) => {
            // from body of `example`
            if content.len() < state.min_len {
                let bar_txt_future = async_read_file("bar.txt");
                // `.await` operation
                let state = WaitingOnBarTxtState {
                    content,
                    bar_txt_future,
                };
                *self = ExampleStateMachine::WaitingOnBarTxt(state);
            } else {
                *self = ExampleStateMachine::End(EndState));
                return Poll::Ready(content);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this match arm we first call the `poll` function of the `foo_txt_future`. If it is not ready, we exit the loop and return `Poll::Pending` too. Since `self` stays in the `WaitingOnFooTxt` state in this case, the next `poll` call on the state machine will enter the same match arm and retry polling the `foo_txt_future`.

When the `foo_txt_future` is ready, we assign the result to the `content` variable and continue to execute the code of the `example` function: If `content.len()` is smaller than the `min_len` saved in the state struct, the `bar.txt` file is read asynchronously. We again translate the `.await` operation into a state change, this time into the `WaitingOnBarTxt` state. Since we're executing the `match` inside a loop, the execution directly jumps to the match arm for the new state afterwards, where the `bar_txt_future` is polled.

In case we enter the `else` branch, no further `.await` operation occurs. We reach the end of the function and return `content` wrapped in `Poll::Ready`. We also change the current state to the `End` state.

The code for the `WaitingOnBarTxt` state looks like this:

```rust
ExampleStateMachine::WaitingOnBarTxt(state) => {
    match state.bar_txt_future.poll(cx) {
        Poll::Pending => return Poll::Pending,
        Poll::Ready(bar_txt) => {
            *self = ExampleStateMachine::End(EndState));
            // from body of `example`
            return Poll::Ready(state.content + &bar_txt);
        }
    }
}
```

Similar to the `WaitingOnFooTxt` state, we start by polling the `bar_txt_future`. If it is still pending, we exit the loop and return `Poll::Pending` too. Otherwise, we can perform the last operation of the `example` function: Concatenating the `content` variable with the result from the future. We update the state machine to the `End` state and then return the result wrapped in `Poll::Ready`.

Finally, the code for the `End` state looks like this:

```rust
ExampleStateMachine::End(_) => {
    panic!("poll called after Poll::Ready was returned");
}
```

Futures should not be polled again after they returned `Poll::Ready`, therefore we panic if `poll` is called when we are already in the `End` state.

We now know how the compiler-generated state machine and its implementation of the `Future` trait _could_ look like. In practice, the compiler generates code in different way. (In case you're interested, the implementation is currently based on [_generators_], but this is only an implementation detail.)

[_generators_]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html

The last piece of the puzzle is the generated code for the `example` function itself. Remember, the function header was defined like this:

```rust
async fn example(min_len: usize) -> String
```

Since the complete function body is now implemented by the state machine, the only thing that the function needs to do is to initialize the state machine. The generated code for this could look like this:

```rust
fn example(min_len: usize) -> ExampleStateMachine {
    ExampleStateMachine::Start(StartState {
        min_len,
    })
}
```

The function no longer has an `async` modifier since it now explicitly returns a `ExampleStateMachine` type, which implements the `Future` trait. As expected, the state machine is constructed in the `Start` state and the corresponding state struct is initialized with the `min_len` parameter.

Note that this function does not start the execution of the state machine. This is a fundamental design decision of Rust's futures: They do nothing until they are polled for the first time.

### Pinning

We already stumbled across _pinning_ multiple times in this post. Now is finally the time to explore what pinning is and why it is needed.

#### Self-Referential Structs

As explained above, the state machine transformation stores the local variables of each pause point in a struct. For small examples like our `example` function, this was straightforward and did not lead to any problems. However, things become more difficult when variables reference each other. For example, consider this function:

```rust
async fn pin_example() -> i32 {
    let array = [1, 2, 3];
    let element = &array[2];
    async_write_file("foo.txt", element.to_string()).await;
    *element
}
```

This function creates a small `array` with the contents `1`, `2`, and `3`. It then creates a reference to the last array element and stores it in an `element` variable. Next, it asynchronously writes the number converted to a string to a `foo.txt` file. Finally, it returns the number referenced by `element`.

Since the function uses a single `await` operation, the resulting state machine has three states: start, end, and "waiting on write". The function takes no arguments, so the struct for the start state is empty. Like before, the struct for the end state is empty too because the function is finished at this point. The struct for the "waiting on write" state is more interesting:

```rust
struct WaitingOnWriteState {
    array: [1, 2, 3],
    element: 0x1001a, // address of the last array element
}
```

We need to store both the `array` and `element` variables because `element` is required for the return type and `array` is referenced by `element`. Since `element` is a reference, it stores a _pointer_ (i.e. a memory address) to the referenced element. We used `0x1001a` as an example memory address here. In reality it needs to be the address of the last element of the `array` field, so it depends on where the struct lives in memory. Structs with such internal pointers are called _self-referential_ structs because they reference themselves from one of their fields.

#### The Problem with Self-Referential Structs

The internal pointer of our self-referential struct leads to a fundamental problem, which becomes apparent when we look at its memory layout:

![array at 0x10014 with fields 1, 2, and 3; element at address 0x10020, pointing to the last array element at 0x1001a](self-referential-struct.svg)

The `array` field starts at address 0x10014 and the `element` field at address 0x10020. It points to address 0x1001a because the last array element lives at this address. At this point, everything is still fine. However, an issue occurs when we move this struct to a different memory address:

![array at 0x10024 with fields 1, 2, and 3; element at address 0x10030, still pointing to 0x1001a, even though the last array element now lives at 0x1002a](self-referential-struct-moved.svg)

We moved the struct a bit so that it starts at address `0x10024` now. The problem is that the `element` field still points to address `0x1001a` even though the last `array` element now lives at address `0x1002a`. Thus, the pointer is dangling with the result that undefined behavior occurs on the next `poll` call.

#### Possible Solutions

There are two fundamental approaches to solve the dangling pointer problem:

- **Update the pointer on move:** The idea is to update the internal pointer whenever the struct is moved in memory so that it is still valid after the move. Unfortunately, this approach would require extensive changes to Rust that would result in potentially huge performance losses. The reason is that some kind of runtime would need to keep track of the type of all struct fields and check on every move operation whether a pointer update is required.
- **Forbid moving the struct:** As we saw above, the dangling pointer only occurs when we move the struct in memory. By completely forbidding move operations on self-referential structs, the problem can be also avoided. The big advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented at the type system level without additional runtime costs. The drawback is that it puts the burden of dealing with move operations on possibly self-referential structs on the programmer.

Rust understandably decided for the second solution. For this, the [_pinning_] API was proposed in [RFC 2349](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2349-pin.md). In the following, we will give a short overview of this API and explain how it works with async/await and futures.

#### Heap Values

The first observation is that [heap allocated] values already have a fixed memory address most of the time. They are created using a call to `allocate` and are not moved in memory until they are freed through a `deallocate` call again. This is required because a `Box<T>` is essentially a pointer to the heap memory, so that an address change would make the pointer invalid.

[heap allocated]: @/second-edition/posts/10-heap-allocation/index.md

Using heap allocation, we can try to create a self-referential struct:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut heap_value = Box::new(SelfReferential {
        self_ptr: 0 as *const _,
    });
    let ptr = &*heap_value as *const SelfReferential;
    heap_value.self_ptr = ptr;
    println!("heap value at: {:p}", heap_value);
    println!("internal reference: {:p}", heap_value.self_ptr);
}

struct SelfReferential {
    self_ptr: *const Self,
}
```

([Try it on the playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=ce1aff3a37fcc1c8188eeaf0f39c97e8))

When we execute this, we see that the address of heap value and its internal pointer are equal, which means that the `self_ptr` field is valid. Since the `heap_value` variable is only a pointer, moving it (e.g. by passing it to a function) does not change the address, so that the `self_ptr` stays valid.

However, there is still a way to break this: We can move out of a `Box<T>` or replace its content:

```rust
let stack_value = mem::replace(&mut *heap_value, SelfReferential {
    self_ptr: 0 as *const _,
});
println!("value at: {:p}", &stack_value);
println!("internal reference: {:p}", stack_value.self_ptr);
```

([Try it on the playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=e160ee8a64cba4cebc1c0473dcecb7c8))

Here we use the [`mem::replace`] function to replace the heap allocated value with a new struct instance. This allows us to move the original `heap_value` to the stack, while the `self_ptr` field of of the struct still points to the heap. When you try to run the example on the playground, you see that the printed _"value at:"_ and _"internal reference:"_ lines show indeed different pointers.

[`mem::replace`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/mem/fn.replace.html

The fundamental problem is that `Box<T>` allows us to get a `&mut T` reference to the heap allocated value. This `&mut` reference allows us to to use methods like [`mem::replace`] or [`mem::swap`] to invalidate the heap allocated value. To resolve this problem, we must prevent that `&mut` references to self-referential structs can be created.

[`mem::swap`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/mem/fn.swap.html

#### `Pin<Box<T>>` and `Unpin`

The pinning API provides a solution to the `&mut T` problem in form of the [`Pin`] wrapper type and the [`Unpin`] marker trait. The idea behind these types is to gate all methods of `Pin` that can be used to get `&mut` references (e.g. [`get_mut`][pin-get-mut] or [`deref_mut`][pin-deref-mut]) on the `Unpin` trait. The `Unpin` trait is an [_auto trait_], which is automatically implemented for all types except types that explicitly opt-out. By making self-referential structs opt-out of `Unpin`, there is no (safe) way to get a `&mut T` from a `Pin<Box<T>>` type for them. As a result, their internal self-references are guaranteed to stay valid.

[`Pin`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/pin/struct.Pin.html
[`Unpin`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html
[pin-get-mut]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.get_mut
[pin-deref-mut]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/struct.Pin.html#impl-DerefMut
[_auto trait_]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/special-types-and-traits.html#auto-traits

As an example, let's update the `SelfReferential` type from the above example to opt-out of `Unpin`:

```rust
use core::marker::PhantomPinned;

struct SelfReferential {
    self_ptr: *const Self,
    _pin: PhantomPinned,
}
```

We opt-out by adding a second `_pin` field of type [`PhantomPinned`]. This type is a zero-sized marker type whose only purpose is to _not_ implement the `Unpin` trait. Because of the way [auto traits][_auto trait_] work, a single field that is not `Unpin` suffices to make the complete struct opt-out of `Unpin`.

[`PhantomPinned`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/marker/struct.PhantomPinned.html

The second step is to change the `Box<SelfReferential>` type in the example to a `Pin<Box<SelfReferential>>` type. The easiest way to do this is to use the [`Box::pin`] function instead of [`Box::new`] for creating the heap allocated value:

[`Box::pin`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.pin
[`Box::new`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.new

```rust
let mut heap_value = Box::pin(SelfReferential {
    self_ptr: 0 as *const _,
    _pin: PhantomPinned,
});
```

In addition to changing `Box::new` to `Box::pin`, we also need to add the new `_pin` field in the struct initializer. Since `PhantomPinned` is a zero sized type, we only need its type name to initialize it.

When we [try to run our adjusted example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=961b0db194bbe851ff4d0ed08d3bd98a) now, we see that it no longer works:

```
error[E0594]: cannot assign to data in a dereference of `std::pin::Pin<std::boxed::Box<SelfReferential>>`
  --> src/main.rs:10:5
   |
10 |     heap_value.self_ptr = ptr;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot assign
   |
   = help: trait `DerefMut` is required to modify through a dereference, but it is not implemented for `std::pin::Pin<std::boxed::Box<SelfReferential>>`

error[E0596]: cannot borrow data in a dereference of `std::pin::Pin<std::boxed::Box<SelfReferential>>` as mutable
  --> src/main.rs:16:36
   |
16 |     let stack_value = mem::replace(&mut *heap_value, SelfReferential {
   |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
   |
   = help: trait `DerefMut` is required to modify through a dereference, but it is not implemented for `std::pin::Pin<std::boxed::Box<SelfReferential>>`
```

Both errors occur because the `Pin<Box<SelfReferential>>` type no longer implements the `DerefMut` trait. This exactly what we wanted because the `DerefMut` trait would return a `&mut` reference, which we want to prevent. This only works because we both opted-out of `Unpin` and changed `Box::new` to `Box::pin`.

The problem now is that the compiler does not only prevent moving the type in line 16, but also forbids to initialize the `self_ptr` field in line 10. This happens because the compiler can't differentiate between valid and invalid uses of `&mut` references. To get the initialization working again, we have to use the unsafe [`get_unchecked_mut`] method:

[`get_unchecked_mut`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.get_unchecked_mut

```rust
// safe because modifying a field doesn't move the whole struct
unsafe {
    let mut_ref = Pin::as_mut(&mut heap_value);
    Pin::get_unchecked_mut(mut_ref).self_ptr = ptr;
}
```

([Try it on the playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=b9ebbb11429d9d79b3f9fffe819e2018))

The [`get_unchecked_mut`] function works on a `Pin<&mut T>` instead of a `Pin<Box<T>>`, so we have to use the [`Pin::as_mut`] for converting the value before. Then we can set the `self_ptr` field using the `&mut` reference returned by `get_unchecked_mut`.

[`Pin::as_mut`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.as_mut

Now the only error left is the desired error on `mem::replace`. Remember, this operation tries to move the heap allocated value to stack, which would break the self-reference stored in the `self_ptr` field. By opting out of `Unpin` and using `Pin<Box<T>>`, we can prevent this error and safely work with self-referential structs. Note that the compiler is not able to prove that the creation of the self-reference is safe (yet), so we need to use an unsafe block and verify the correctness ourselves.

#### Stack Pinning and `Pin<&mut T>`

In the previous section we learned how to use `Pin<Box<T>>` to safely create a heap allocated self-referential value. While this approach works fine and is relatively safe (apart from the unsafe construction), the required heap allocation comes with a performance cost. Since Rust always wants to provide _zero-cost abstractions_ when possible, the pinning API also allows to create `Pin<&mut T>` instances that point to stack allocated values.

Unlike `Pin<Box<T>>` instances, which have _ownership_ of the wrapped value, `Pin<&mut T>` instances only temporarily borrow the wrapped value. This makes things more compilicated, as it requires the programmer to ensure additional guarantees themself. Most importantly, a `Pin<&mut T>` must stay pinned for the whole lifetime of the referenced `T`, which can be difficult to verify for stack based variables. To help with this, crates like [`pin-utils`] exist, but I still wouldn't recommend pinning to the stack unless you really know what you're doing.

[`pin-utils`]: https://docs.rs/pin-utils/0.1.0-alpha.4/pin_utils/

For further reading, check out the documentation of the [`pin` module] and the [`Pin::new_unchecked`] method.

[`pin` module]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/index.html
[`Pin::new_unchecked`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.new_unchecked

#### Pinning and Futures

As we already saw in this post, the [`Future::poll`] method uses pinning in form of a `Pin<&mut Self>` parameter:

[`Future::poll`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll

```rust
fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output>
```

The reason that this method takes `self: Pin<&mut Self>` instead of the normal `&mut self` is that future instances created from async/await are often self-referential, as we saw [above][self-ref-async-await]. By wrapping `Self` into `Pin` and letting the compiler opt-out of `Unpin` for self-referentual futures generated from async/await, it is guaranteed that the futures are not moved in memory between `poll` calls. This ensures that all internal references are still valid.

[self-ref-async-await]: @/second-edition/posts/12-async-await/index.md#self-referential-structs

It is worth noting that moving futures before the first `poll` call is fine. This is a result of the fact that futures are lazy and do nothing until they're polled for the first time. The `start` state of the generated state machines therefore only contains the function arguments, but no internal references. In order to call `poll`, the caller must wrap the future into `Pin` first, which ensures that the future cannot moved in memory anymore.

Since the `Pin<&mut Self>` interface is predefined by the `Future` trait, there is no way to use the safer `Pin<Box<Self>>` instead. This can make it quite challenging to safely implement `Future` yourself. For this reason I recommend against implementing `Future` manually and instead sticking to using async/await and the combinator methods of the [`futures`] crate.

[`futures`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/

In case you're interested in understanding how to safely implement `Future` yourself, take a look at the relatively short [source of the `map` combinator method][map-src] of the `futures` crate and the section about [projections and structural pinning] of the pin documentation.
